            <h3>Berlin, the city of no hills</h3>
            <p>
              Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of
              the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust
              memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during
              the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a
              symbol of reunification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.
              Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector,
              encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup
              companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention
              venues. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail
              traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network.
              The metropolis is a popular tourist destination. Significant
              industries also include information technology, healthcare,
              biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction,
              electronics, social economy and clean tech.
